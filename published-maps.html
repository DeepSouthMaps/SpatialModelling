                <h3>Using the Map</h3>
        Click and drag to move around the map. Scroll to zoom, or use the toggle in the top left corner. Toggle between satellite image or a map as the base layer using the "openstreetmap" and "Satellite" option in the menu in the top right hand corner. Other option in the right hand corner are used to toggle datasets. Hover over the data to see further details. Use the "Back to systems diagram" button to return to the main interface.
                <h3>Bayesian Network Models</h3>
        Bayesian network models are a type of probabilistic model which are comprised of a series of nodes and arcs. The nodes (boxes) are variables, while the arcs (arrows) indicate a probabilistic dependance between the variables. In discrete Bayesian networks (as shown here), each of the nodes has different states. When evidence is set (in this case, we select the emissions pathways), the network calculates subsequent probabilities of each of the states occurring in all the other nodes.

                <h3>Campylobacter Risk under Extreme Rainfall</h3>
                Here we present the finding from the analysis of the comparison of Campylobacter Risk under different extreme rainfall scnearios. Historical rainfall is used to determine quintiles (groupings of preciptiation into 5 categories) on a local government area basis, and linear modelling is used to connect the historical incidence of Campylobacter infection with the rainfall.

        <h3>Connecting Ground Water to Climate Scenarios</h3>
        Here, we demonstrate the connection between climate scenarios and the groundwater system, and we discuss the potential follow on impact on the risk to the public of Campylobacter infection, as one indicator of wellbeing.
      <h3>Groundater Model Output</h3>
        We undertake groundwater modelling, forcing the model (XXX) with historical data. Three scenarios were simulated: base conditions (03/01/1972 to 31/12/2021), wet conditions (01/07/2018 to 30/06/2019) and dry conditions (01/07/2020 to 30/06/2021). Lines on the map indicate the stream flow rates, and the background shading indicates the groundwater head at the surface. The results show increasing flow rates through the waterways of the Heretaunga plains, with a particularly significant increase in flow under wet conditions in the Upper Ngaruroro River.

      <h3>Modelling Ngaruroro River-Groundwater Exchange</h3>
        The model below draws on the data produced from the ground water modelling, and combines it with historical precipitation records (MFE 2018) and precipitation projections under different emissions pathways (NIWA 2023). The target variable for this modelling work is the absolute flux between groundwater and the surface water, since these fluxes presents a pathway for pathogens to enter the groundwater system, and an increase in flux presents an increase in risk of infections, such as Campylobacter. <br>
        Under climate change, it is expected that there will be an increase in extremes: more years with higher than average rainfall, and more years with lower than average rainfall, compared to present. Toggling between the different climate scenarios
        Toggling between the climate scenarios shows how increasing probabilities of extreme conditions (both wet and dry) increase the probability of higher exchanges with groundwater and surface water.
