            The analysis shown on this webpage is part of the output from the project <i>Informing local wellbeing decisions under climate uncertainty: a systems approach to evaluating economic and public health outcomes of climate change adaptation options.</i> <br><br>
        
        This Deep South National Science Challenge project is a collaboration between Market Economics, GNS Science, University of Otago, Resilient Organisations, and EM Consulting. The project aims to provide a visual representation of the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the economy, environment, and public health in New Zealand. To do so, we have developed a primary interface to conceptualise future water-related climate change-induced impacts and to highlight the potential for decision-making support (<a href="https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/nicolamcdonald/deep-south-project-interface/index.html#page1">Link to the primary interface</a>).<br><br>
        
        The finding presented on this webpage are in support of the systems modelling on the primary interface. Here, we zoom in on specific aspects of the system and show how detailed analysis can be used to better understand specific aspects of the system. We demonstrate the connection between between climate change, the hydrological cycle, and the potential impact on health through a case study of Campylobacter, a potential pathogen.

                <h3>Campylobacter Infection Risk under Extreme Rainfall</h3>
                
                 Here we present an analysis of the connection between campylobacter infection risk and extreme rainfall. This analysis highlights a specific connection between the climate system and public health as shown on the <a href="https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/nicolamcdonald/deep-south-project-interface/index.html#Public_Health_&_Water_Quality/page3">main interface</a>.<br><br>
                
                We obtained estimated daily rainfall totals by 2013 meshblock boundaries, based on the Virtual Climate Station Network dataset (2000-2020). From these data, we calculated 30-day cumulative sums of rainfall by meshblock, census area unit, and Regional Council boundaries and national quintiles of the 30-day cumulative sums. Nationwide notifications of campylobacter for the years 2000-2019 inclusive were aggregated by 2013 census area unit and month. We ran space-time permutation models with and without rainfall as a covariate. With no covariates in the model, a statistically significant space-time cluster was detected, centred on Havelock North in August 2016, with 809 cases observed and 23 expected; (observed per expected: 35.26). When 30-day cumulative rainfall was included in the model as a covariate, with other parameters unchanged, the cluster remained statistically significant, but with 918 cases observed and approximately 129 expected (observed per expected: 7.13). <br><br>

                Using the same data but at daily time steps, aggregated to Regional Council scale, case crossover analysis using conditional Poisson regression suggested linear associations between cumulative 30-day rainfall and campylobacter notifications in some regions (Waikato, Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Wellington and Canterbury). When the rainfall data were reclassified into national quintiles, the upper quintiles of rainfall were significantly associated with campylobacter notifications in Waikato, Hawkes Bay, Manawatu and Canterbury. <br>
The interactive map can be used to visualise both the rainfall and the percentage increase in risk from campylobacter infection.

         <h3>Connecting Ground Water to Climate Scenarios</h3>
        In this tab, we demonstrate the connection between climate scenarios and the groundwater system, and we discuss how this may change the risk of infection from pathogens present in waterways. This captures a subset of the connections shown on the <a href="https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/nicolamcdonald/deep-south-project-interface/index.html#Hydrological_System/page5">main interface </a>.
        
      <h3>Groundater Model Output</h3>
        We used the model MODFLOW to simulate the hydrological cycle around the Heretaunga plains/Napier region, using boundary conditions defined from, and conditioned by, historical data. These boundary conditions included stream flow rate into the modelling area and groundwater recharge. This model forcing was defined for three scenarios: base conditions, defined as the average from 03/01/1972 to 31/12/2021, wet conditions, using a wet climate period from the historical record (from 01/07/2018 to 30/06/2019), and dry conditions, using a dry climate period from historical record (from 01/07/2020 to 30/06/2021). The numerical model is conditioned to historical system observations of water levels and stream flows. For each scenario, there is an ensemble of simulated outputs with varying parameterisations. The ensembles provide a distribution of model outputs that represent the model uncertainty. <br><br>

Lines on the map indicate the stream locations, and the stream colour represents flow rates (mean of all realisations). The background shading indicates the mean groundwater head (water table elevation). The results show significantly higher flow rates during wetter conditions, with a particularly significant increase in flow under wet conditions in the Upper Ngaruroro River. Exchange from surface water to groundwater (river loss) is minimally affected but the wetter scenario, across the domain the net exchange from groundwater to surface water (stream gain) increases under wetter conditions. <br><br>

These results are preliminary, and should be viewed as proofs of concepts.

       <h3>Modelling Ngaruroro River-Groundwater Exchange</h3>
        Here we develop a basic BN structure to connect the ground water modelling to climate scenarios, and we hypothesis about what this could mean for the risk of infection from pathogens. <br><br>

The Bayesian network model below draws on the ground water modelling output and combines it with historical precipitation records (MFE 2018) and precipitation projections under different emissions pathways (NIWA 2023). The realisations from the ground water modelling output are used to generate the input probability distributions for Bayesian network.<br><br>

We select the flux (exchange between ground water and surface water) and the stream flow rates as the target variable for this modelling work. These fluxes from surface water to groundwater presents pathways for pathogens to be transported, likely increasing the risk of infection from waterborne pathogens, such as Campylobacter. <br><br>
Connected to flux is the stream flow rate, since high stream flow rates are associated with high flux of surface water to ground water. Stream flow rate is divided into states of low, medium and high, while flux also includes a very high category, due to a long tail on the distribution of flux values. Connected to the stream flow rate is the recharge node, which describes groundwater being replenished from precipitation. Both of these nodes are influenced by the general climate, which has states of the different RCP scenarios and present day conditions (defined as the base scenario). <br><br>

Under climate change, there will be an increase in extremes: more years with higher than average rainfall, and more years with lower than average rainfall, compared to present. Use the panel in the right hand corner to toggle between wet, dry and base scenarios. The model results show that under wet and dry scenarios, both the stream flow rate and the flux between surface and ground water are more extreme, while the base scenario is associated with more moderate outcomes. Both the wet and dry scenarios are more likely to occur under higher emissions scenarios compared to present, while base conditions are more likely under present day conditions. Among other issues highlighted on the systems diagram in the main interface, these extreme wet and dry conditions provide increased pathways for pathogens to move through our waterways and increase the risk of infection.

    <b>Hover here for further information on Bayesian networks.</b>
    <span class="tooltip-text"> Bayesian network models are a type of probabilistic model, which are comprised of a series of nodes and arcs. The nodes (boxes) are variables, while the arcs (arrows) indicate a probabilistic dependance between the variables. In discrete Bayesian networks (as used in this project), each of the nodes has different states, which represent different conditions under which the node can be. When information is known about the states of variables in the network, evidence can be set, and the statistics behind the network are used to calculate subsequent probabilities of each of the states occurring in all other nodes in the network. By providing probabilities rather than a single outcome, Bayesian networks provide an indicate of uncertainty in the system.</span>
